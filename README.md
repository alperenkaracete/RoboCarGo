RoboCarGo – Robot Cargo Delivery Game

Welcome to RoboCarGo, a fun and colorful cargo delivery challenge!
Take control of a robot car and deliver packages to the right customers based on color.

🚗 How It Works:
Pick up a cargo package – your car changes its color to match the package.

Find the customer with the matching color and make the delivery.

Once delivered, your car returns to its original blue color.

You can carry only one package at a time – no multitasking allowed!

📦 Package Info:
While carrying a package, the color of the current cargo is clearly shown.

After each delivery, the remaining number of packages is displayed.

🏁 Win Condition:
Deliver all packages correctly to win!

Once all deliveries are completed, a Victory Screen appears to celebrate your success.
